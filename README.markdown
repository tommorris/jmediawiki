JMediaWiki
==========

A Java library for using the MediaWiki API.

Is it ready yet?
----------------

Hell no.

Why?
----

Wikipedia bot authors need good libraries. Most libraries aren't up to scratch.
I'd like to try and build one that doesn't suck too much, in Java.

Ideally, the core will be written in Java and there will be a variety of
libraries available to wrap around JMediaWiki to make it work better in Scala,
Clojure or other languages.

Can I help?
-----------

Yes. Please do. Recommended developer setup is Eclipse and Maven. You'll need
[Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org) installed in Eclipse: follow the
installation instructions on the Lombok website (don't worry, it's easy).

Please write tests for everything you add. That way we can refactor it to make
it not suck. JavaDocs are nice too.

I will decide a license very soon. Whatever I decide, it'll be good. It'll most
likely be something like MIT or BSD.
